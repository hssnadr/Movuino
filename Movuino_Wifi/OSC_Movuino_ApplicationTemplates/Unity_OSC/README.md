# OSC template for Unity

This template shows how to use OSC inside Unity. It receives acceleration data of the Movuino streamed by the Python template (see Python folder).  

* Reference: https://github.com/jorgegarcia/UnityOSC (thanks!)  

### Note
* Everything is accessible from the OSCControl.cs script.
* The script PythonLauncher.cs allows to launch Python script directly from Unity. It's not already implemented but feel free to use it (beware you have to launch it on a separate thread).
